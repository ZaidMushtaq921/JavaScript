 1. click:-> A mouse button is clicked over an element.
2. dblclick:-> A mouse button is double-clicked over an element.
3. focus:-> The element gets focused (for example, when a text field is clicked and ready to receive input).
4. blur:-> The element loses focus (for example, when a text field is clicked out of).
5. mouseover:-> The mouse pointer is moved onto an element or onto one of its children.
6. mouseout:-> The mouse pointer is moved out of an element or out of one of its children.
7. mousemove:-> The mouse pointer is moved while it is over an element.
8. keydown:-> A key is pressed down.
9. keypress:-> A key is pressed down, and that key normally produces a character value (use of this event is deprecated).
10. keyup:-> A key is released.

    // Event objects
    /*
      Sometimes, inside an event handler function, you'll see a parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e.
    
1-> The target property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.
   
2-> Preventing default behavior: If you want to stop an event from doing anything by default, you call the preventDefault() method.

3->Event bubbling(innermost to outermost ):- Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements. This behavior can be useful and can also cause unexpected problems.Fixing the problem with stopPropagation()
